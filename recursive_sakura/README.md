# Recursive Cherry Blossom Tree
Project made with p5.js to practice recursive functions. Uses the noise function from the p5.js library to imitate a wind effect on the trees branches and falling cherry blossom petals. 
## Files
- **index.html** - The html file where sketch.js is called and calls the p5.js library
- **sketch.js** - The main file where the tree is drawn
## Folders
- **libraries** - The p5.js library, not much else to say...maybe thanks for reading my README? 
## Terrible joke
- Where do you weigh a pie? ....Somewhere over the rainbow. Think about it for a bit.. get it? **Ba dum chik**
